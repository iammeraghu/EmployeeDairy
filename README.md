# EmployeeDetails
Android app built with Kotlin to store employee Details in Realtime cloud Database
 changlog: to bring additional option to update and delete already saved details directly from Recycler View 
 To Connect with your realtime database, create a realtime database with firebase and add JSON file to the projects under app in project view(advised to choose default US server to work flawlessly)
